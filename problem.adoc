# Realtime-Streaming-PCF-Microservices-Docker

This demo is extension of link:https://github.com/kgshukla/Realtime-Streaming-PCF-Microservices-BDS/blob/master/problem.adoc[Realtime-Streaming-PCF-Microservices-BDS] demo that I created using Spring Boot applications. We pushed all application code directly into Pivotal Cloud Foundry. In this demo, we model all our Microservices as Docker Images and instead of pushing our code, we push Docker images into Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

This demo aims to solve problem that appeared in DEBS challenge 2015

http://www.debs2015.org/call-grand-challenge.html

Stream of taxi data comes in real time for new york region. Region is to be divided into areas, each measuring 300mx300m. Following questions needs to be solved in real time


image::images/problemstmt.jpg[]


Question 1 - For every 10 seconds, find out the top 10 routes where taxies are plying the most from one area to another area.

Question 2 - For every 10 seconds, find out the top 3 routes (areas) 

Question 3 - For every 10 seconds, find out free taxies (show only 50 in the map) available in the region

Question 4 - For every 10 seconds, find out how much data is incorrectly reported by taxi drivers

Question 5 - For every 10 seconds, find out how much time does your product takes to compute the above 4 things

Below questions need not be answered in real time -

Question 6 - For overall data, find out who are the taxi drivers not reporting the data correctly

Question 7 - For overall data, find out top 10 taxi drivers earning the most

=== Solution Architecture

We use following Pivotal products to implement the solution

a. SpringXD (real time data gets ingested via SpringXD)
b. Spark (real time streams are sent to Spark for computing Q1-5 above)
c. Gemfire (output from Spark goes into Gemfire)
d. PHD/HAWQ (real time data is also sent (via springXD's tap) to PHD so that we could answer Q6 and A7 above)
e. Pivotal Cloud Foundry where we deploy our applications
f. Spring Cloud Services to make microservices driven architecture work
g. Microservices are modeled as Spring Boot applications. The web application is built using PHP and Google Charts.
h. Docker Images are created using Spring Boot applications and stored on Docker Hub. We then pushed Docker images directly into PCF.

See the below diagram for the stack used. NP stands for network packets so the stream would come as traffic on EC2's network port. SpringXD would be listening to this port.

The below diagram depicts the Microservices based applications. In my earlier link:https://github.com/kgshukla/Realtime-Streaming-PCF-BDS[solution], I created only one application (monolithic application that was based on php and google charts). I have broken down this application into multiple microservices and use spring cloud services (config-server, service-registry and circuit-breaker) to build a resilient and scalable architecture as shown below.

image::images/solution_architecture_2.png[]

As shown in the image above, we have following microservices. All these microservices are modeled as Docker Images. To get the code please refer to our previous link:https://github.com/kgshukla/Realtime-Streaming-PCF-Microservices-BDS[demo].

1. EventService - this is a spring boot application that retrieves it's coniguration from config-server (like gemfire host and port to connect to) and exposes few http end points related to events - like how many events (every data in the stream is an event) have been processed, how many events have missing data entries, how much time it takes to process events in a window of 10 second. This service retrieves data from Gemfire.

2. TaxiService - this is a spring boot application that retrieves it's coniguration from config-server and exposes few http end points related to taxi information - like what are the top 10 routes, where are free taxies available in a window of 10 seconds. This service retrieves data from Gemfire.

3. AnalyticService - this is a spring boot application that retrieves it's coniguration from config-server and exposes few http end points related to analytic queries - like who are the drivers reporting incorrect data, who are the drivers earning the mostover collected data. This service retrieves data from PHD/HAWQ. We will not deploy this application in this demo.

4. AggService (aggregator service) - this is a spring boot application that talks to the above 3 microservices using service-registry. It also utilizes circuit-breaker which gets activated automatically in case any of the microservice fails (due to connectivity to data source, or they are not up or network failure). This service exposes all end points to the web application.

5. PHP based web app - this is a php application that calls AggService's exposed endpoints to retrieve data and show it on a web page. 


All these Docker images and php web app will be deployed on Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

=== Launch Amazon AMI 

In order to make it simpler, we've created the Amazon AMI to launch instances quickly. This AMI contains Pivotal Big Data Suite components needed in the demo - SpringXD, Spark, Pivotal Hadoop, Pivotal HAWQ and Gemfire. There is no .pem requirement to login in to the EC2 instance once AMI is launced.

Log in to your AWS account and search for "Name" attribute with value "PCF Microservice" (available in Singapore region - ami-7d5c9c1e, US East (N. Virginia) - ami-9d1f51f7 and US West (N. California) - ami-84afc7e4)

- Launch it and make sure you choose m4.xlarge (16GB) instance size. Note: You could also try with t2.large (8GB) - we tried it and it works, however you may experience slowness.

- Auto assign a public IP address

- Add 25 GB SSD storage

- Keep all traffic open on all ports in your security group settings

- No need to choose a key pair.

Once launched, you could ssh to machine using gpadmin/changeme credentials.

----

You will see that there is a module spark-taxi in Sink. This is nothing but a spark module which has been uploaded already in SpringXD. This spark module is written in java and contains the business logic of getting stream data. Stream data is collected over a window of 10 seconds and then business logic is applied to find out answers of Q1-Q5 and upload the data in Gemfire's region. The jar file is located at /var/www/html/streamtaxi/jar/spark-taxi-0.1.0.jar. 

We will make the source code public soon.

Create your first stream

xd:>stream create --name stream-topx --definition "tcp --outputType=text/plain --decoder=LF | spark-taxi " --deploy

This stream basically listens to all data coming to tcp default port and sending it to the spark module. When you run SpringXD in singlenode configuration, you could also have spark running inside SpringXD. In a real world scenario, Spark will be running separately.

[source,bash]
----
xd:>stream create --name stream-topx --definition "tcp --outputType=text/plain --decoder=LF | spark-taxi " --deploy
Created and deployed new stream 'stream-topx'
xd:>
----

Make sure it is deployed correctly by checking that there are no errors in SpringXD single node terminal 

=== Deploy Docker images in Pivotal Cloud Foundry

First you need to clone (git clone) the repository on your laptop. 

Then, you need to have access to Pivotal Cloud Foundry installation that has Spring Cloud Services enabled. 

Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry instacne

[source,bash]
----
$cf login -a <pivotal cloud foundry api url> --skip-ssl-validation
----

Choose a valid org and space.

Let's quickly create 3 spring cloud services that we would need. You could go to Pivotal Cloud Foundry web console and create these services as well. We would use command line interface to create quickly. You could also run ./scripts/createservice.sh script.

[source,bash]
----
$cf create-service p-config-server standard config-server 

$cf create-service p-service-registry standard service-registry

$cf create-service p-circuit-breaker-dashboard standard circuit-breaker
----

Wait for 60 seconds to get these services initialized. After that you should go to Pivotal Cloud Foundry Console, choose your org and space and you should be able to see all these services. Click on "Manage" link under config-server. 

image:images/service_init.png[]

As mentioned in the solution proposition, all microservices gets data from config-server. We use information like gemfire host, gemfire port, database host, database port, database username as part of configuration that will be picked up by microservices after they have been pushed to PCF and bind to config-server (ie during the startup time). I have created my own repository on github - https://github.com/kgshukla/iot-taxi-config-repo which has application.yml file where I provide these details. You need to create your own, update the IP addresses (leave gemfire and db ports, db username, password unchanged) in application.yml file and push it to git. IP Address would be the public IP address of your EC2 instance where gemfire and PHD/HAWQ are running.

The below screen depicts the git url that you need to update. The git url need to be under your own git repository. 

image::images/configuration.png[]

Let's push eventservice docker image now. Before you push open manifest-eventservice.yml file and update the CF_TARGET value with your PCF's API address (one that you used earlier to login into PCF). Do it for all manifest-*.yml files.

[source,bash]
----
$cf push -o kgshukla/taxi-iot:eventservice_v1 -f manifest-eventservice.yml
----

From here you could infer that we have already created eventservice docker image in kgshukla/taxi-iot repository. You could see details link:https://hub.docker.com/r/kgshukla/taxi-iot/[here]. Notice that, the way we created this image is by compiling eventservice code (which is available link:https://github.com/kgshukla/Realtime-Streaming-PCF-Microservices-BDS[here]) and then pushing the eventservice jar file into base Docker image. See full description on docker hub kgshukla/taxi-iot page to understand what commands are used to create this image.

Once eventservice is successfully pushed and started, go to Pivotal Cloud Foundry web console, go to org and space and click on "Manage" link under Service Registry. You cshould see EVENTSERVICE-IOT-V1 service registered as shown below.

image:images/eventservice_registration.png[]

push rest of the microservices (remember to change CF_TARGET value in manifest-*.yml files)

[source,bash]
----
$cf push -o kgshukla/taxi-iot:taxiservice_v1 -f manifest-taxiservice.yml
$cf push -o kgshukla/taxi-iot:aggregatorservice_v1 -f manifest-aggservice.yml
----

Under Service-Registry you should see all services getting registered. All of them have picked gemfire, database values from config-server and are now up and running. 

image:images/allservices_registration.png[]

Let's push the final web application.

Replace <url of aggservice microservice> value appropriately. Do not provide http:// or https://. For example, my url while pushing the aggservice microservice was aggservice-iot.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io. So. I will provide following below while creating user provided service

$cf create-user-provided-service agg_service_d_iot -p '{"AGGSERVICE_URL":"aggservice-d-iot.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io"}'

[source,bash]
----
$cd webapps_php
$cf create-user-provided-service agg_service_d_iot -p '{"AGGSERVICE_URL":"<url of aggservice microservice>"}'
$cf push
----

Note down the APP_URL that you get after succesfully pushing the application.

=== Start streaming taxi data on network port

Run the following command on EC2 instance to start streaming data on network port

[source,bash]
----
$cat /var/www/html/streamtaxi/sampledata/sorted_data.csv | nc localhost 1234
----

Access your application at http://<APP_URL> and see that the data is being shown on the website

=== Try following use cases

1. You could now scale each microservice independently. Notice on scaling, each instance registers itself to Service-Registry.
2. Stop one of the microservice, say eventservice, and see the behavior - circuit breaker kicks in and start providing default values (ie 0 for total events processed, spark processing time etc). Click on "Manage" link under Circuit-Breaker (in Pivotal Cloud Foundry web console) and see the state of circuit breaker.

image:images/streaming_img1.png[]

3. Make sure EventService has only 1 instance running. Load this url http://<eventservice url>/load .. This will kill eventservice application. See how PCF brings back the application on its own. Also notice, how circuit breaker kicks in during the microservice failure. As shown below, you would see red circles on circuit breaker dashboard.

image:images/circuit_breaker.png[]

4. Change gemfire ip address (give arbitrary IP address) in your configuration file (application.yml) and then scale one of the microservice. Notice that it would not be able to startup as it tries to get gemfire IP address from config server during startup. The ones that are already running are not affected.


=== Further Exercises

1. Right now eventservice, taxiservice and analyticservice are also exposed to the entire world. You could go to http://<eventserviceurl>/mappings to see all the exposed urls (one of them is /events/total). You only want aggservice to be available to the outside world. How would you make these three services secure? (HINT - use --no-route option while deploying. But then once you do that, how would these services register their url to service-registry? ;-) )

2. How would you configure your 3 microservices deployment such that any any requests coming from applications other than aggservice microservice should be discarded? (HINT - use space security groups)

3. Think about how would you do version upgrade of eventservice microservice. what all changes you would need to do?


=== Cleanup your environment

Run scripts/cleanup.sh script to delete all services, applications and routes

[source,bash]
----
$sh scripts/cleanup.sh
----

And don't forget to stop/terminate AWS EC2 instance.
